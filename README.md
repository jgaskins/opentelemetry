# OpenTelemetry

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is an observability framework for cloud-native software.

This Crystal shard allows you to add it to your applications to export application telemetry to OpenTelemetry-compatible services, such as:

- [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io)
- [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
- [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)
- [Lightstep](https://lightstep.com)

You can see more at the OpenTelemetry website.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```
   dependencies:
     opentelemetry:
       github: jgaskins/opentelemetry
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

To use this shard, you'll need to have a service setup to receive OpenTelemetry data. In this example, we'll use Honeycomb:

```crystal
require "opentelemetry"

OpenTelemetry.configure do |c|
  c.exporter = OpenTelemetry::BatchExporter.new(
    OpenTelemetry::HTTPExporter.new(
      endpoint: URI.parse("https://api.honeycomb.io"),
      headers: HTTP::Headers{
        # Get your Honeycomb API key from https://ui.honeycomb.io/account
        "x-honeycomb-team"    => ENV["HONEYCOMB_API_KEY"],
        # Name this whatever you like. Honeycomb will create the dataset when it
        # begins reporting data in Honeycomb Classic accounts
        "x-honeycomb-dataset" => ENV["HONEYCOMB_DATASET"],
      },
    )
  )
end
```

Note: The shard supports using `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` and `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variables to populate the trace's associated resource (dataset in the Honeycomb example above).

### Instrumenting

Use the `OpenTelemetry.trace` method to create a new trace for the current fiber or to add a span inside the current trace.

```crystal
OpenTelemetry.trace "outer-span" do |span|
  span["my-attribute"] = "my value"
  # do some work

  OpenTelemetry.trace "inner-span" do |span|
    span["another-attribute"] = "another value"
    # do some work
  end

  # do some work
end
```

### `HTTP::Server` middleware

If you are instrumenting a Crystal web app, you will want to add a `OpenTelemetry::Middleware` instance to your server middleware stack, passing in the name of the root span.

```crystal
http = HTTP::Server.new([
  # ...
  OpenTelemetry::Middleware.new("http.server.request"),
  # ...
])
```

### Integrations

You enable many integrations simply by requiring them. They will be instrumented automatically.

```crystal
# Load the integration for the crystal-lang/crystal-db shard
require "opentelemetry/integrations/db"
```

You can see all of the integrations available in [the integrations directory](https://github.com/jgaskins/opentelemetry/tree/main/src/integrations).
